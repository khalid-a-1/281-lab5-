# CS 281: Intro to Computer Systems

## Lab05 - JK Flip Flops and Sequential Circuits

#### Overview

##### Exploration: The JK Flip-Flop

The 7476 chip provides the hardware realization of two JK Flip-Flops, numbered 1 and 2. The pinouts
for the 7476 are given below. In this exploration, we want to put the 7476 on our breadboard, and wire
it up and experiment with it so that we can better understand its operation.
